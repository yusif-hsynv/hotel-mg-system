## üß† Reservation Logic Overview
When creating a reservation:
1. The system checks if the **room** and **customer** exist and are active.  
2. It verifies that the **check-in** and **check-out** dates are valid.  
3. It checks room **availability** for overlapping dates using the repository query.  
4. If available, the **total price** is calculated automatically based on the room‚Äôs price and stay duration.  
5. The reservation is saved successfully to the database.
